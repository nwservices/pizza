# Pizzeria Website

This project contains a website for a fictional pizzeria.

## Before You Get Started

In order to build the site files and serve a live preview locally you will need a few tools installed on your computer.

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
* [Bower](http://bower.io/)

## Build Instructions

* Clone this repo
* From your command line, CD into this repo's directory
* Run `npm install`
* Run `bower install`
* Run `grunt server`

The build process will take a few seconds (a new "dist" folder will be created) and when it is complete a new web browser tab should open with the website served locally. This tab is using live preview functionality, so if you edit any of the site's HTML, Sass, or JS the site will automatically rebuild the relevant assets and refresh the browser tab.
